BudgetBuddy
===========

Budgeting program, simple checkbook for now, more advanced features later.

Currently supports:
  - Multiple Accounts and transfers between own accounts
  - Tagging of transactions to categorize data
  - Day and Night themes

The configuration file (config.php) should be placed one directory above the document root of BudgetBuddy. This is for security reasons. If you'd like to place it within the BudgetBuddy directory, you'll have to modify the includes to reflect that.

 - SQL tables to come...
