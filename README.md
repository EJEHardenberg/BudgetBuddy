BudgetBuddy
===========

Budgeting program, simple checkbook for now, more advanced features later.

Currently supports:
  - Multiple Accounts and transfers between own accounts
  - Tagging of transactions to categorize data
  - Day and Night themes

The configuration file (config.php) should be placed one directory above the document root of BudgetBuddy. This is for security reasons. If you'd like to place it within the BudgetBuddy directory, you'll have to modify the includes to reflect that.

 - SQL database and tables can be generated by navigating to the setup.php file. The file will run and if successful you should see the messages stating so.
